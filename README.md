Eaglercraft 1.14.4 - Java Port
-
This is a 1.8.8 client with 1.13 and 1.14 features added. This client is written in Javascript and ported to JS using the batch file on linux.

**Note**: The new blocks and items on this client will probably not work on a real Minecraft 1.13+ server that is not eaglercraft only because the ids are no longer numerical after the great flattening in 1.13.
