🏗️ Eaglercraft 1.14.4 - Java Port
-
This is a 1.8.8 knockoff client with 1.13 and 1.14 features added. This client is written in Java and ported to JS using the batch file on linux. All assets and AI are ripped from the real game. Will be merged with 1.12.2 (hopefully)

**Note**: The new blocks and items on this client will probably not work on a real Minecraft 1.13+ server that is not eaglercraft only because the ids are no longer numerical after the great flattening in 1.13. So stick with eaglercraft for now!
